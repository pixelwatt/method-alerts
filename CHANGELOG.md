## CHANGELOG

# v1.0.0

This initial release of Method Alerts allows you to add and maintain alerts via the added method_alerts post type, and supports individual page targeting and scheduling. For alerts to appear, you must add '<div class="method-alerts-container"></div>' to your template files, at the location you wish for alerts to appear.
